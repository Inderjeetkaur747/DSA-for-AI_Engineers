# DSA for AI Engineers

A **practical, interview-focused DSA roadmap** designed specifically for **AI / ML Engineers**.


PHASE 1 — LINEAR DATA PATTERNS (Highest ROI)

70% of interview questions start here

1. Arrays & Hashing

Patterns inside this:

Frequency counting

Prefix sum

Index mapping

In-place modification

AI relevance: feature counts, vocab mapping, data preprocessing

2. Two Pointers

Patterns inside this:

Opposite direction pointers

Fast/slow pointers

Partition logic

AI relevance: deduplication, streaming data cleanup

3. Sliding Window

Patterns inside this:

Fixed window

Variable window

At-most / exactly-k trick

AI relevance: time-based logs, rolling metrics, sequence modeling prep

PHASE 2 — STRUCTURAL THINKING

Where interview difficulty jumps

4. Stack & Monotonic Stack

Patterns inside this:

Next greater/smaller

Expression evaluation

Span problems

5. Binary Search (Advanced)

Patterns inside this:

Search on answer

Lower/upper bound

Rotated arrays

This is where “expert” level shows.

PHASE 3 — POINTER & TREE RECURSION

Tests depth of thinking

6. Linked Lists

Cycle detection

Reversal patterns

7. Trees (DFS/BFS)

Patterns inside this:

Top-down vs bottom-up

Path problems

Level traversal

AI relevance: decision trees, hierarchical data

PHASE 4 — PRIORITY & CONNECTIVITY

 Real-world systems style questions

8. Heap / Priority Queue

Top-K

Streaming median

9. Graphs

Patterns inside this:

BFS / DFS

Union-Find

Topological sort

AI relevance: knowledge graphs, dependency systems

PHASE 5 — DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING (Interview-Safe Mastery)

Not “all DP”, only useful DP.

10. DP Patterns

1D DP

2D DP

State compression

Knapsack-style thinking

Goal: recognize DP, not fear it.
